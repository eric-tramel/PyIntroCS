Recall that when we use a harmonic analysis such as the Fourier transform or the DCT, we seek to represent our signal as a superposition of many periodic (*infinitely long*) sinusoids. These sinusoids are completely non-local. As such, a single sinusoid will tell us some information about every time sample, and vice-versa. \n",
